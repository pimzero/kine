Kine: Kine Is Not an Emulator
=============================

I wanted to play with the new prctl PR_SET_SYSCALL_USER_DISPATCH, so I wrote an
emulation layer for github.com/lse/k. It also seemed like a good opportunity to
throw some assembly and few calls to modify_ldt(2) :).

Usage
-----

```
$ ./kine  -p "/tmp/ref-k/iso" /tmp/ref-k/roms/perrodlauncher/perrod
```
